I'm a senior research scientist with Ph.D. degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering.
My interests include Machine Learning applied to NLP, ASR and CV.

In addition to some theoretical analysis on Machine Learning (ML) models, I invented ML algorithms, of which I would highlight maximum margin training methods for neural networks, such as [Support Vector Neural Networks (SVNN)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0925231213008333) and [maximum-margin GDX (MMGDX)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/5451102), the [feature selector based on genetic algorithms and information theory](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1007570408004346), and the [parallel seq2seq model](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.10122.pdf), wich was applied to [generative chatbots](https://github.com/oswaldoludwig/Seq2seq-Chatbot-for-Keras). You can find most of my publications on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=QLqId3kAAAAJ&hl=en), and codes available on [GitHub](https://github.com/oswaldoludwig) and [Mathworks](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/profile/authors/2447136-oswaldo-ludwig). Iâ€™m currently working on long-term research on Machine Learning and its applications in automatic speech recognition (ASR), including audiovisual ASR (voice + lip reading) and low footprint neural language models at [Cerence Inc](https://www.cerence.com/).
